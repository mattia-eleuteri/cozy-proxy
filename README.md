# cozy-proxy

A simple kube-proxy addon for 1:1 NAT services in Kubernetes using an NFT backend.

This project ensures a one-to-one mapping between a service and a pod in Kubernetes.

## Why

At [Cozystack](https://cozystack.io), we strive to follow the standard Kubernetes network architecture by separating the pod network, service networks, and external load balancers. However, our platform also runs virtual machines that sometimes require an external IP address.

There are several ways to achieve this:
- Using a separate Kube-OVN subnet and exposing it via BGP with kube-ovn-speaker.
- Adding a secondary interface with Multus.
- Using native Kubernetes services with externalIPs and exposing them via MetalLB.

The last option is the simplest and most flexible, but it has a limitation: Kubernetes services do not forward all traffic,
but only traffic on specific ports (see: [Kubernetes Issue #23864](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23864)).
Additionally, kube-proxy does not perform SNAT, which causes outgoing traffic from the pod to use the default gateway of the host where it is running.

To address these issues, we have added an additional controller that performs NAT for services carrying the `service.kubernetes.io/service-proxy-name: cozy-proxy` label.

## How It Works

cozy-proxy is a simple Kubernetes controller that watches for services labeled with `service.kubernetes.io/service-proxy-name: cozy-proxy` — the standard Kubernetes mechanism for delegating a service to a non-default proxy. kube-proxy skips services carrying this label, so cozy-proxy becomes the sole handler and no rules collide.

When it finds such a service, it creates NFT rules that forward traffic from the service's external IP to the pod's IP and vice versa, performing source-IP preservation for egress traffic.

This controller can be used together with kube-proxy and Cilium in kube-proxy replacement mode.

> The label is the **only** selector. Services that do not carry it are not managed by cozy-proxy, regardless of any annotations they may have.

## Ingress mode

The optional `networking.cozystack.io/wholeIP` annotation selects the ingress mode for a managed service:

| Value     | Behavior                                                                                                              |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"true"`  | **Whole-IP passthrough.** All TCP/UDP traffic to the LoadBalancer IP is forwarded to the backend pod.                 |
| `"false"` | **Per-port filtering** (default). Only TCP/UDP traffic to ports listed in `Service.spec.ports` is forwarded; rest dropped. |
| absent    | Same as `"false"` — per-port filtering.                                                                               |

In both modes, egress traffic from the backend pod is SNATed to the
LoadBalancer IP for source-IP preservation.

The optional `networking.cozystack.io/allowICMP: "true"` annotation, only
meaningful in port-filter mode (`wholeIP: "false"`), accepts ICMP traffic
toward the backend pod IP that would otherwise be dropped by the per-port
filter. Without it, all ICMP to a port-filtered pod is dropped — which also
blocks `ping`, **PMTU discovery** (ICMP "fragmentation needed"), and ICMP
unreachable signalling. Recommended for any service where path-MTU mismatches
or observability matter.

## Datapath

The nftables ruleset placed in table `ip cozy_proxy` consists of:

- Chain `egress_snat` at priority `raw` (-300): rewrites packet source IP via
  the `pod_svc` map for outbound traffic from managed pods. Runs before
  conntrack so the recorded tuple has `saddr=LB_IP`.
- Chain `ingress_dnat` at priority `mangle` (-150): rewrites packet
  destination IP via the `svc_pod` map for inbound traffic to a LoadBalancer
  IP. Runs after conntrack so reply packets of egress flows are matched
  correctly.
- Chain `port_filter` at priority `filter` (0): for Services in port-filter
  mode (`wholeIP: "false"`), drops ingress packets whose
  `(daddr, l4proto, dport)` is not in `allowed_ports`. The chain accepts
  packets in conntrack states `established` or `related` first, so reply
  packets of egress flows bypass the filter even when their dport is the VM's
  ephemeral source port. ICMP is dropped by default; if the
  `allowICMP: "true"` annotation is set, the pod IP is added to
  `icmp_allowed_pods` and ICMP toward it is accepted before the drop rule.

### Rule scoping

The two rewrites are deliberately not scoped alike. Every controller instance
watches every Service, but programs:

| Object | Scope | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `svc_pod` (`ingress_dnat`), `allowed_ports`, `icmp_allowed_pods` | the node hosting the backend pod | A non-hosting node would rewrite the destination before the packet has even left it. The hosting node then records a conntrack tuple of `(client -> podIP)`, while the reply leaves the pod and gets `saddr` rewritten to the service IP by `egress_snat` at priority `raw`, before conntrack. `(svcIP -> client)` matches nothing, so the reply is not `established` and `port_filter` drops it. |
| `pod_svc` (`egress_snat`) | every node | An intra-cluster client is source-NATed by the CNI to its own node address, which the overlay knows how to reach directly. The backend's reply is then tunnelled straight to that node and never traverses the hosting node's netfilter hooks, so the client's node is the only place left where the pod IP can still be turned back into the service IP. Without the entry there, the reply arrives with the wrong source and the client answers with a RST — a cross-node connection that hangs while the same-node one works. |

`NODE_NAME` carries the node identity. When it is unset the ingress scope
check is disabled and everything is programmed everywhere, so the binary still
runs under a chart that does not inject it.

## Installation

Install controller using Helm-chart:

```bash
helm install cozy-proxy charts/cozy-proxy -n kube-system
```

## Usage

Create a LoadBalancer service with the `service.kubernetes.io/service-proxy-name: cozy-proxy` label. The default mode is per-port filtering, so to forward every port to the backend pod (whole-IP passthrough) add the `networking.cozystack.io/wholeIP: "true"` annotation:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  labels:
    service.kubernetes.io/service-proxy-name: cozy-proxy
  annotations:
    networking.cozystack.io/wholeIP: "true"
spec:
  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  ports:
  - port: 65535 # any
  selector:
    app: nginx
  type: LoadBalancer
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: docker.io/library/nginx:alpine
```

Check that the service has an external IP:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

Example output:

```console
NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)     AGE
example-service   LoadBalancer   10.96.195.46   1.2.3.4         65535/TCP   84s
```

Now try to access the service using `icmp` and `tcp`; both should work:

```bash
ping 1.2.3.4
curl 1.2.3.4
```

Check external IP from inside the pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -ti nginx -- curl icanhazip.com
```

Example output would be the same as the service external IP:
```console
1.2.3.4
```

## Environment

This controller was developed primarily for the [Cozystack](https://cozystack.io) platform and has been tested in the following environment:
- **OS**: Talos Linux
- **CNI**: Kube-OVN with Cilium in chaining mode.
- **Kube-proxy**: Cilium in kube-proxy replacement mode.
- **LoadBalancer**: MetalLB in L2 mode with `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`.

*If you have tested it in other environments, please let us know.*
